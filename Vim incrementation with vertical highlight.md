In `vim` one can increment the numbers by pressing `ctrl+a` and `ctrl+x` . Today I've learned that if you have a visual selection (e.g. vertical highlight with `ctrl+v` ) of numbers, you can press `g` and then `ctrl+a/x` to increment/decrease numbers sequentially, i.e.:

```
1                                   1
1                                   2
1                                   3
1  ──────────────────────────────►  4
1                                   5
1                                   6
1                                   7
```


This is a little tip that can be easily forgotten, but can really save a lot of time.
