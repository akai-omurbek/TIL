You don't have to be stuck with the youtube-dl as there are several forks of the program with various improvements, one of them is [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/#installation), which offers the solution for the throttling problem youtube-dl experienced earlier. 

To make yt-dlp replace youtube-dl out of the box, install the arch package `yt-dlp-drop-in`. This will replace all youtube-dl executives. Enjoy!
