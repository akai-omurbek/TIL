Learning RegEx might be much easier if you learn it on the fly or as a mental exercise during your leisure time. I started using the [RegexPal app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andkorsh.regexpal&hl=en&gl=US). 

I am not sure if this is the official app of the [eponymous site](https://www.regexpal.com/). Still I love it, especially the possibility to save your RegEx patterns!
