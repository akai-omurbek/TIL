While writing a post for my wiki, I learned that it is possible to embed an image with a caption. It requires using `HTML` directly in the document:
```
<figure>
  <img src="path/to/file.png" alt="img"
  <figcaption>caption text</figcaption>
</figure>
``` 
If you have to do it on a regular basis, just create a snippet for it and use in your text editor.
